            We recommend that you fly to Heathrow Airport and then take a
            National Rail train from St Pancras station to Nottingham. You can
            get to St Pancras station using the London Underground.

            Try to book your National Rail tickets as far in advance as
            possible, as these can get expensive otherwise. You can use{" "}

            your tickets.

            As an alternative, it can be cheaper to take a coach instead of the
            train, although this is less straightforward and will take longer.
            These are the main coach providers in the UK:{" "}
